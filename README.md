# Predicting Food-Borne Illness Outbreak in US States (2016-2026)
### _predicting incriminating foods and toxins for risk mitigation_

[![Web App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web%20App-View%20Dashboard-blue)](https://ye2qsj-temi.shinyapps.io/my_food_app/)

This project predicts food-related illness risks from 2016-2026 using historical data from 1998-2015. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to help identify high-risk foods, toxins, and geographic areas for food safety planning and prevention.

## Features

- **State-specific predictions** for all US states
- **Three prediction categories**: Food items, Toxins, and Total Illnesses
- **Dual modeling approach**: ARIMA and ETS forecasting methods
- **Interactive filtering** by year, month, and state
- **Risk rankings** to identify highest-risk items
- **Time series visualization** showing trends from 2016-2026

## Key Components

### 1. Food Risk Analysis
Predicts which food items are most likely to cause foodborne illnesses, ranked by risk level with state-specific insights.

### 2. Toxin Risk Analysis  
Identifies toxins most commonly associated with food outbreaks, helping prioritize food safety testing.

### 3. Illness Predictions
Forecasts total number of food-related illnesses expected, enabling resource planning for healthcare systems.

## Methodology

The project uses time series forecasting models trained on historical food outbreak data from 1998-2015 to predict risks for 2016-2026. Both ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal) models are employed to provide robust predictions.

## Project Structure

- **[app.R](app.R)** - Main Shiny dashboard application
- **[deploy_app.R](https://github.com/temidataspot/food-illness-prediction/blob/main/deploy_app.R)** - Web deployment to Shiny
- **[CSVs](https://github.com/temidataspot/food-illness-prediction/tree/main/CSVs-Predictions_Performance)** - Folder containing all prediction data files
- **[scripts](https://github.com/temidataspot/food-illness-prediction/tree/main/R-Scripts)** - Analysis scripts for model building
- **[RDS]([docs/](https://github.com/temidataspot/food-illness-prediction/tree/main/RDS-Files))** - RDS Files
  
## Usage

1. Visit the [Web Application](https://ye2qsj-temi.shinyapps.io/my_food_app/)
2. Select your preferred model (ARIMA or ETS)
3. Filter by state, year range, and specific months
4. Explore the three main views: Foods, Toxins, and Illnesses
5. Identify high-risk items 

## Data Sources

- Kaggle

## Dashboard Views
